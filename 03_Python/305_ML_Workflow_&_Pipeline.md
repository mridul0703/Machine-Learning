# 305. Building Basic ML Workflows & Pipelines

A **Machine Learning (ML) workflow** is the sequence of steps followed to build, train, validate, and deploy a machine learning model. Understanding and implementing proper workflows ensures reproducibility, scalability, and efficient experimentation.

---

## 🧩 1. What is an ML Workflow?

An ML workflow defines the **end-to-end process** of solving a machine learning problem. It helps transform raw data into valuable insights or predictions.

### 🔹 Typical ML Workflow:
1. Data Collection  
2. Data Preprocessing  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Selection & Training  
5. Model Evaluation  
6. Model Deployment  
7. Monitoring & Maintenance

Each stage can be automated and managed through **pipelines** for consistency and efficiency.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Step-by-Step Breakdown

### **1. Data Collection**
- Gather data from multiple sources:
  - Databases, APIs, Web Scraping, IoT devices, etc.
- Store data in structured formats (CSV, SQL, Parquet) or data lakes.

> **Tip:** Ensure data integrity — check for duplicates, missing values, and outliers early.

---

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
Before training, data needs cleaning and normalization.

**Common preprocessing steps:**
- Handling missing values (mean/median imputation)
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (Normalization, Standardization)
- Removing outliers

**Libraries Used:**
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn.preprocessing`

---

### **3. Feature Engineering**
Transform raw data into features that improve model performance.

**Techniques:**
- Polynomial features  
- Binning and discretization  
- Feature selection using correlation or model-based importance  
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, LDA)

> Feature engineering often contributes **80% of the effort** in ML projects.

---

### **4. Model Selection & Training**

Choose the algorithm that best fits your problem:
- **Classification:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest, etc.  
- **Regression:** Linear Regression, Ridge/Lasso, Gradient Boosting, etc.  
- **Clustering:** K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering.  

**Training involves:**
- Splitting dataset into Train/Test (or Train/Validation/Test)
- Fitting model parameters on training data
- Hyperparameter tuning using:
  - Grid Search (`GridSearchCV`)
  - Random Search (`RandomizedSearchCV`)
  - Bayesian Optimization

---

### **5. Model Evaluation**
Assess model performance using metrics that match the problem type:

| Problem Type | Common Metrics |
|---------------|----------------|
| Classification | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC |
| Regression | MSE, RMSE, MAE, R² |
| Clustering | Silhouette Score, Davies–Bouldin Index |

Use **cross-validation** to ensure generalization and avoid overfitting.

---

### **6. Model Deployment**

Once trained and validated, the model can be integrated into production systems via:
- REST APIs (using Flask, FastAPI, or Django)
- Batch processing pipelines
- Model serialization formats like `pickle`, `joblib`, or `ONNX`

**Deployment Platforms:**
- AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, Azure ML, or custom Docker containers.

---

### **7. Monitoring & Maintenance**

Even after deployment, models must be:
- **Monitored:** for accuracy degradation (data drift, concept drift)
- **Updated:** retrained periodically with new data
- **Versioned:** using MLflow, DVC, or Weights & Biases (W&B)

---

## 🔄 3. Introduction to ML Pipelines

An **ML pipeline** is an automated sequence of data transformations and modeling steps.

### **Why use pipelines?**
- Ensures **reproducibility** of experiments  
- Prevents **data leakage**  
- Simplifies **model deployment**  
- Makes workflows **modular and maintainable**

---

### **Example: Scikit-learn Pipeline**

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Example pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('model', LogisticRegression())
])

# Fit and predict
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)
```

Advantages:
- Combines preprocessing and modeling into one object.
- Simplifies grid search and cross-validation.
- Ensures preprocessing applies identically to training and test data.

## 🧮 4. Workflow Automation & Experiment Tracking

Tools for Workflow Automation:

- Kubeflow — Scalable ML pipelines on Kubernetes
