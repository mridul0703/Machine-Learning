# 101. Introduction to Machine Learning

## 🧩 What is Machine Learning?
**Machine Learning (ML)** is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing step-by-step rules, we provide examples (data), and the computer figures out the rules itself.

**Formal Definitions**
- **Arthur Samuel (1959):** "The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
- **Tom Mitchell (1997):** A program is said to learn from experience **(E)** with respect to some task **(T)** and a performance measure **(P)**, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with E.
  - **Task (T):** Spam classification.
  - **Experience (E):** Training on emails marked spam/ham.
  - **Performance (P):** Accuracy on unseen emails.

## ⚙️ Why Do We Need Machine Learning?
- Many problems are too complex for rule-based programming.
- ML can adapt automatically to new data.
- It saves time and effort compared to writing thousands of rules.
- **Example:**
  - **Rule-based spam filter:** Requires manual rules like “if email contains ‘win money,’ then mark as spam.”
  - **ML-based spam filter:** Learns automatically from email content and user history.

## 🚀 Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Learns from **labeled data** (input-output pairs).
  - *Example:* Predicting house prices, spam detection.

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Learns from **unlabeled data** to find hidden patterns.
  - *Example:* Customer segmentation, topic modeling.

- **Reinforcement Learning**
  - Learns by interacting with an environment and receiving **rewards or penalties**.
  - *Example:* Game-playing AI, robotics.

## 🔧 Components of a Machine Learning System
- **Dataset:** Input examples used for training (features + labels).
- **Model:** A mathematical function that learns patterns and makes predictions.
- **Training Algorithm:** The process that optimizes the model based on the dataset.
- **Evaluation:** The method used to measure the model's performance and accuracy.
