# 505. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

Gradient Boosting is one of the most powerful and widely used ensemble techniques in Machine Learning.  
It builds a **strong predictive model** by combining multiple **weak learners (usually decision trees)** in a sequential manner ‚Äî each correcting the errors of the previous one.

---

## üß© 1. What is Boosting?

**Boosting** is an **ensemble method** that combines several **weak learners** to create a **strong learner**.

### Idea:
- Train a sequence of models.
- Each model tries to **fix the mistakes** made by the previous one.
- Final prediction = weighted sum of all weak learners.

### Comparison of Ensemble Methods:

| Method | Combines Models | Sequence | Example |
|---------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Bagging** | In parallel | No | Random Forest |
| **Boosting** | Sequentially | Yes | AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost |

## üîπ 2. Intuition Behind Gradient Boosting

Gradient Boosting uses **gradient descent** to minimize the **loss function** by adding weak learners sequentially.

### Step-by-step intuition:
1. Start with an initial prediction (often mean for regression).
2. Compute the **residuals** (errors).
3. Fit a weak learner (e.g., shallow decision tree) to these residuals.
4. Update the model by adding the new tree‚Äôs predictions, scaled by a learning rate.
5. Repeat until convergence.

## üîπ 3. Mathematical Formulation

We want to minimize a **loss function** $( L(y, F(x)) \)$ :

1. Initialize model:
```math
F_0(x) = \arg\min_c \sum_i L(y_i, c)
```

2. For each iteration $( m = 1, 2, ..., M \)$ :
   - Compute pseudo-residuals:
```math
r_{im} = - \left[\frac{\partial L(y_i, F(x_i))}{\partial F(x_i)}\right]_{F(x)=F_{m-1}(x)}
```
   - Fit a weak learner $( h_m(x) \)$ to predict $( r_{im} \)$
   - Compute optimal step size:
```math
\gamma_m = \arg\min_\gamma \sum_i L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + \gamma h_m(x_i))
```
   - Update model:
```math
F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \eta \gamma_m h_m(x)
```
where $( \eta \)$ = **learning rate**

## üîπ 4. Key Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **n_estimators** | Number of boosting rounds (trees) |
| **learning_rate (Œ∑)** | Shrinks contribution of each tree (trade-off: small Œ∑ ‚Üí more trees) |
| **max_depth** | Controls tree complexity |
| **subsample** | Fraction of samples used per tree (for regularization) |
| **colsample_bytree** | Fraction of features used per tree |
| **loss** | Objective function (e.g., `mse`, `logloss`) |

---

## üîπ 5. Regularization in Gradient Boosting

Regularization prevents overfitting by controlling the model complexity.

- **Shrinkage**: Multiply each tree‚Äôs contribution by a small learning rate $( \eta \)$ .
- **Subsampling**: Train each tree on a random subset of data.
- **Tree pruning**: Limit depth or minimum samples per leaf.
- **L1/L2 penalties**: Used in advanced GBM libraries like XGBoost.
