# 602. Biasâ€“Variance Tradeoff

The **Biasâ€“Variance Tradeoff** is one of the most fundamental concepts in Machine Learning.  
It helps us understand the **performance of models** and **why they might underfit or overfit** the data.

---

## ðŸ§© 1. Introduction

When we train a machine learning model, we aim to achieve **low prediction error** on **unseen data**.  
However, errors can arise due to two main factors:

1. **Bias** â†’ Error due to overly simplistic assumptions.
2. **Variance** â†’ Error due to sensitivity to small fluctuations in training data.

The goal is to find the **optimal balance** between bias and variance.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Total Error Decomposition

The **Expected Prediction Error (EPE)** can be decomposed as:

```math
E[(y - \hat{f}(x))^2] = \text{Bias}^2[\hat{f}(x)] + \text{Variance}[\hat{f}(x)] + \sigma^2
```

Where:
- **BiasÂ²** â†’ Error from wrong model assumptions (underfitting)
- **Variance** â†’ Error from model sensitivity (overfitting)
- **ÏƒÂ² (Irreducible Error)** â†’ Noise in the data (cannot be removed)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Understanding Bias

**Bias** measures how far the modelâ€™s predictions are from the true relationship.

- High bias â†’ Model is too simple (e.g., linear model on non-linear data)
- Low bias â†’ Model fits training data well

| Example | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| Linear Regression on Non-linear Data | High Bias |
| Deep Neural Network | Low Bias |

**Result:** High bias leads to **underfitting**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Understanding Variance

**Variance** measures how much the modelâ€™s predictions change when trained on different subsets of data.

- High variance â†’ Model is too complex, fits noise
- Low variance â†’ Model generalizes consistently

| Example | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| Deep Neural Network with Small Dataset | High Variance |
| Ridge Regression | Low Variance |

**Result:** High variance leads to **overfitting**.

- Left side: **High Bias**, low Variance (Underfit)
- Right side: **Low Bias**, high Variance (Overfit)
- Middle: **Optimal Tradeoff** â†’ Best generalization

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Relationship Between Model Complexity and Error

| Model Complexity | Bias | Variance | Total Error |
|------------------|------|-----------|--------------|
| Low | High | Low | High |
| Medium | Moderate | Moderate | **Low (Optimal)** |
| High | Low | High | High |

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Finding the Optimal Tradeoff

To balance bias and variance:
- **Increase model complexity** until underfitting reduces.
- Use **cross-validation** to detect overfitting.
- Apply **regularization (L1/L2)** to control variance.
- Gather more data to stabilize model learning.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Practical Techniques

| Technique | Reduces | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Regularization (Ridge, Lasso) | Variance | Penalizes large weights to avoid overfitting |
| Ensemble Methods (Bagging, Boosting) | Variance | Combines models to reduce noise |
| Cross-validation | Both | Detects over/underfitting through performance consistency |
| Simplifying Model | Variance | Reduces sensitivity to data fluctuations |
| Adding More Data | Variance | Stabilizes learning and reduces noise impact |

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Summary

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Bias** | Error from overly simplistic assumptions |
| **Variance** | Error from model sensitivity to training data |
| **Tradeoff** | Balance between underfitting and overfitting |
| **Goal** | Minimize total error for optimal generalization |
