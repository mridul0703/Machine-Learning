# 101. What is Machine Learning?

## 📖 Introduction

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on building systems that can **learn from data** rather than being explicitly programmed.

In simple words — **A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. — Tom Mitchell, 1997**

> 💡 Example: Just like humans learn from experience, machines learn from data.

## 🤔 Why Do We Need Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is useful when:
- The problem is **too complex** for traditional rule-based programming.
- There’s **a large amount of data** available to learn from.
- The system needs to **adapt automatically** to new patterns or information.

### 📌 Real-Life Examples
- 📧 **Email Spam Detection** – ML models identify spam emails automatically.
- 🛒 **Product Recommendations** – Online stores suggest items based on user behavior.
- 🏥 **Healthcare Diagnosis** – ML helps detect diseases from medical scans.
- 💳 **Fraud Detection** – Banks use ML to recognize unusual transactions.

## 🧩 Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

| Aspect | Traditional Programming | Machine Learning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Approach** | Write rules manually | Learn patterns from data |
| **Data Used** | Predefined instructions | Examples or past experiences |
| **Adaptability** | Needs manual update | Improves with more data |
| **Example** | Hard-coded spam filters | Spam filter that learns automatically |

## ⚙️ How Does Machine Learning Work?

Machine Learning works in a **data-driven cycle**:

1. **Input Data** → The information we give to the machine.
2. **Learning Process** → The model identifies patterns from data.
3. **Model Creation** → The system builds a rule or function.
4. **Prediction** → It uses the rule to make decisions on new data.

📊 **Example:**  
If we feed a machine pictures of dogs and cats, it will learn the difference and later identify whether a new image is a dog or a cat.

## 🧠 A Simple Analogy

Think of teaching a child how to recognize fruits:  
- You show different fruits and say their names (data + labels).  
- Over time, the child learns the differences (training).  
- When shown a new fruit, they can identify it correctly (prediction).  

That’s exactly how Machine Learning works — **learn from examples and improve with experience.**

## 📈 Key Takeaways

- Machine Learning helps computers learn patterns automatically.
- It is a part of Artificial Intelligence.
- Works best when large data is available.
- Improves with experience, similar to how humans learn.
